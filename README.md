Instructions for Code:

NN.py contains the NN code (from hw1): For the first execution, line 672 is uncommented and loads the data. 
After the first run, this line should be uncommented for faster execution (it stores the data in .npy files).
Starting at line 678, the hyper parameters for the network can be set. 
Line 706 specifies the path to where to store data and graphs if needed (commented out now).
!!! ALL TUNABLE PARAMETERS TO BE FOUND BETWEEN LINES 678 and 704 !!!
If done, simply run the code.
